// In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

// Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

// Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
// From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
// You can't visit the same cell more than once.
// Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
// You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
 

// Example 1:

// Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
// Output: 24
// Explanation:
// [[0,6,0],
//  [5,8,7],
//  [0,9,0]]
// Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
// Example 2:

// Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
// Output: 28
// Explanation:
// [[1,0,7],
//  [2,0,6],
//  [3,4,5],
//  [0,3,0],
//  [9,0,20]]
// Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
 

// Constraints:

// m == grid.length
// n == grid[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 15
// 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
// There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
