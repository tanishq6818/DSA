// Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

// If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

// Assume a BST is defined as follows:

// The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
// The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
// Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
// Output: [2]
// Example 2:

// Input: root = [0]
// Output: [0]
 

// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// -105 <= Node.val <= 105
 

// Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count)
