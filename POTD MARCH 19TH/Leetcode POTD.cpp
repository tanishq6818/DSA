You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

​Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

Constraints:

1 <= tasks.length <= 104
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
0 <= n <= 100
  class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        // Building frequency map
        int freq[26] = {0};
        for (char &ch : tasks) {
            freq[ch - 'A']++;
        }

        // Max heap to store frequencies
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                pq.push(freq[i]);
            }
        }

        int time = 0;
        // Process tasks until the heap is empty
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            int cycle = n + 1;
            vector<int> store;
            int taskCount = 0;
            // Execute tasks in each cycle
            while (cycle-- && !pq.empty()) {
                if (pq.top() > 1) {
                    store.push_back(pq.top() - 1);
                }
                pq.pop();
                taskCount++;
            }
            // Restore updated frequencies to the heap
            for (int &x : store) {
                pq.push(x);
            }
            // Add time for the completed cycle
            time += (pq.empty() ? taskCount : n + 1);
        }
        return time;
    }
};
