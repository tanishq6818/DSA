In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.

Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.

 

Example 1:


Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
Example 2:

Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
 

Constraints:

n == position.length
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= position[i] <= 109
All integers in position are distinct.
2 <= m <= position.length

  class Solution {
public:
    // Check if we can place 'm' balls at 'position'
    // with each ball having at least 'x' gap.
    bool canPlaceBalls(int x, vector<int> &position, int m) {
        // Place the first ball at the first position.
        int prevBallPos = position[0];
        int ballsPlaced = 1;

        // Iterate on each 'position' and place a ball there if we can place it.
        for (int i = 1; i < position.size() && ballsPlaced < m; ++i) {
            int currPos = position[i];
            // Check if we can place the ball at the current position.
            if (currPos - prevBallPos >= x) {
                ballsPlaced += 1;
                prevBallPos = currPos;
            }
        }
        // If all 'm' balls are placed, return 'true'.
        return ballsPlaced == m;
    }

    int maxDistance(vector<int> &position, int m) {
        int answer = 0;
        int n = position.size();
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());

        // Initial search space.
        int low = 1;
        int high = ceil(position[n - 1] / (m - 1.0));
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            // If we can place all balls having a gap at least 'mid',
            if (canPlaceBalls(mid, position, m)) {
                // then 'mid' can be our answer,
                answer = mid;
                // and discard the left half search space.
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Discard the right half search space.
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
