// Your music player contains n different songs. You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

// Every song is played at least once.
// A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.
// Given n, goal, and k, return the number of possible playlists that you can create. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
// Output: 6
// Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
// Example 2:

// Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
// Output: 6
// Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
// Example 3:

// Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].
 

// Constraints:

// 0 <= k < n <= goal <= 100
