Given a binary representation in the form of a string(s) of a number n, the task is to find a binary representation of n+1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 11
Explanation: "10" is the binary representation of 2 and binary representation of 3 is "11"
Example 2:

Input: s = "111"
Output: 1000
Explanation: "111" is the binary representation of 7 and binary representation of 8 is "1000"
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function binaryNextNumber()which takes s as input parameter and returns the string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) to store resultant string  

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
   string binaryNextNumber(string s) {

        int i, l = s.size();

        string ans = "";
        for (i = l - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '1')
                s[i] = '0';
            else {
                s[i] = '1';
                break;
            }
        }
        if (i < 0) {
            ans += '1';
            i = 0;
        } else {
            i = 0;
            while (s[i] == '0')
                i++;
        }
        ans += s.substr(i, l);

        return ans;
    }
